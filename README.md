# Find Your Hat

An interactive terminal game where the player has lost their hat in a field of holes. They must navigate to the hat while avoiding the holes. The grid consists of holes (0), a hat (^), an empty space (â–‘), and the player (\* represents a space the player has visited).

The game continues until:

1. The player wins by finding their hat (^).
2. Loses by landing on a hole space (0).
3. Attempts to leave the field.
